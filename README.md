# ARBD: Adaptive Reinforcement-Based Defense

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for implementing and visualizing the Reinforcement Learning Adversarial Blackbox (RLAB) attacks and our Proposed Adaptive Reinforcement-Based Defense (ARBD) Defense using CNN models and VGG-16 models on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets.

Adaptive Reinforcement-Based Defense (ARBD), a novel defense framework designed to mitigate the impact of reinforcement learning-based adversarial attacks. ARBD integrates adversarial training with a pre-processing technique known as feature squeezing, to reduces the influence of small perturbations.
